## (1) Variational Transform

Non-linear functions are not easy to handle. It would be great if we would make it as a linear function. So, how could we transform it?

Like the picture above, we can draw a tangent line at each x's, and this would be the best linear function representing that non-linear function. But the problem is that as the x is getting bigger/smaller from the original x, the gap between two functions will be larger (becoming inaccurate).

But if we change that linear function every time the x changes, (which means that finding all the linear function for every x ), it would be a quite approximation.



### Mathematical Expression

Let's set

- the non-linear function : $$g(x) = lnx$$
- the linear function : $$f(x) = \lambda x + b(\lambda)$$

What we have to do is to minimze the gap between the two functions, $$g(x)$$ and $$f(x)$$
<br>
<br>
$$\underset{x}{min} (f(x)-g(x))$$
<br>
<br>
If we take the derivative...
<br>
<br>
$$\frac{d}{dx} (f(x)-g(x)) = \frac{d}{dx} (\lambda x +b(\lambda) - lnx) = 0$$
<br>
<br>
so the lambda should be like the below
<br>
<br>
$$\lambda = \frac{1}{x}$$
<br>
<br>
Then we could express the equation like..
<br>
<br>
$$\lambda x + b(\lambda) = ln(x)$$
<br>
<br>
$$\lambda (1/\lambda) + b(\lambda) = -ln(\lambda)$$
<br>
<br>
$$b(\lambda) = -ln(\lambda) -1 $$
<br>
<br>
What we can learn from this is that "(even though function is still non-linear with $$\lambda$$) We can treat the non-linear more easily with linear model (in the case of $$x$$)"
<br>
<br>

## (2) Variational Transform on Logistic Function

Logistic Function, which is also called sigmoid function, looks like below.
<br>
<br>
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$
<br>
<br>
It is neither concave nor concave. But we can make this as a concave function by taking logarithm.
<br>

Let the function..
<br>
<br>
$$g(x) = lnx$$
<br>
<br>
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$
<br>
<br>
Then $$g(f(x))$$ would look like
<br>
<br>
$$g(f(x)) =ln(\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}) = -ln(1+e^{-x}) $$
<br>
 ( as you can see, the x range of the function is 0~1, and the y range is -inf~0 )
<br>
  
Then by taking exponential function, we could express like below!
<br>
<br>
$$f(x) = \underset{\lambda}{min} {e^{\lambda x â€“H(\lambda)}}$$
<br>
<br>

## (3) Convex Duality

You have seen that we can approximate non-linear function into linear function. So how can we explain this in more general way?

If $$f(x)$$ is a concave function, we can solve it by the way explained in (1) (above).
But if $$f(x)$$ is not a concave function, we can still solve it by ..

- 1) transform using the "log function"
- 2) re-transform using the "exp function"



### Mathematical Expression
<br>
$$f(x) = \underset{\lambda}{min}{\lambda^T x-f^{*}(\lambda)}$$
<br>
<br>
$$f^{*}(x) = \underset{x}{min}{\lambda^T x-f^{*}(x)}$$
<br>
<br>
