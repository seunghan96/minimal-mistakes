### Hinton, G. E., & Van Camp, D. (1993)

( download paper here :  [Download]({{ '/assets/pdf/BNN/paper/03.Keeping Neural Networks Simple by Minimmizing the Description Length of the Weights.pdf' | /assets/pdf/BNN/paper/03.Keeping Neural Networks Simple by Minimmizing the Description Length of the Weights.pdf }}) )

- MDL (Minimum Description Length) Principle

  - NN generalize weights if "LESS information" is in the weights

  - loss(cost) = 1) + 2)

    - loss 1) cost for describing the model ( = weight penalty )
    - loss 2) describing the misfit between model & data  ( = train loss )

  - bits back argument

    - step 1) sender collapse the weights drawn from $Q(w)$

    - step 2) sender sends each weight for $Q(w)$ and sends the data misfit
    - step 3) receiver recovers the exact same posterior $Q(w)$ with correct output & misfits
    - step 4) calculate true expected description length for a noisy weight

  - start of Variational Inference...?

( download paper here :  [Download]({{ '/assets/pdf/BNN/paper/04.Practical Variational Inference for Neural Networks.pdf' | /assets/pdf/BNN/paper/04.Practical Variational Inference for Neural Networks.pdf }}) )

- introduce "Stochastic Variational method" 

- Key point

  - 1) instead of analytical solutions, use numerical integration
  - 2) stochastic method for VI with a diagonal Gaussian posterior

  - MDL : cost of transmitting the model + cost of transmitting the prior

- Diagonal Gaussian posterior

  - each weight requires a separate mean \& variance
  - cannot compute derivative of loss function(-ELBO) directly.... use MC integration
